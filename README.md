# Spotify_Data_Analysis

Spotify data analysis project - analyzing the most important characteristics of a song getting onto the top 1000 songs

In this project, a group of six other UC Davis students and I analyzed a Spotify dataset from 2023. This dataset included metrics for various popular songs throughout the year of 2023 so far, including track name, artist name, artist count, released year, released month, released day, how many spotify playlists it was in, how many spotify charts it was in, streams, how many apple playlists it was in, how many apple charts it was in, how many deezer playlists it was in, how many deezer charts it was in, how many shazam charts it was in, bpm, key, mode, and several metrics determined by Spotify, including danceability%, valence%, energy%, acousticness%, instrumentalness%, liveness%, and speechiness%.

Using the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries of python, we completed data analysis on this dataset to determine what exactly makes a song popular on Spotify. Our data analysis included understanding underlying distributions on our various variables that could affect Spotify streams (listed above), performing a linear regression for each variable to determine its relationship to streams and creating heat maps to quantify the correlation values, finding distributions of songs considered solo versus collaboration (based on number of artists), and looking at the distribution of streams per key and per mode.
